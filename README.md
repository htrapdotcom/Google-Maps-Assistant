# Google-Maps-Assistant
This mini project demonstrates the creation of an AI assistant using the OpenAI API that can interact with the user to understand location-based queries and automatically open Google Maps with the relevant search. It leverages OpenAI's function calling to connect natural language with a practical tool (Google Maps).
